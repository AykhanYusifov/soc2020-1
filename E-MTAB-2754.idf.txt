Investigation Title	RNA-seq of H3.3 knockout and wild type chicken DT40 cells					
Comment[Submitted Name]	RNA-seq of H3.3 knockout and wild type chicken DT40 cells
Experiment Description	RNA-seq was performed for transcriptional analysis of wild-type DT40 cells (Gallus gallus, B-cell line) and a H3.3 knockout line (h3.3a-/-, h3.3b-/-).  H3.3 is a H3 histone variant encoded on two genes (H3.3A and H3.3B) in chickens.

Protocol Description	Chicken DT40 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 with 7% FBS, 3% chicken serum and supplemented with pen/strep at 37C with 10% CO2.	The source (starting sample for the experiment) were wild type and H3.3 knockout DT40 cells. RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The RNA quality and quantity was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).	Sequencing of RNA from each pool was carried out by BGI (Beijing Genomics Institute) using an Illumina HiSeq2000	Libraries were constructed by BGI (Beijing Genomics Institute)	FASTQ files (Raw data files) were aligned to the Chicken cDNA derived from the Galgal4 genome assembly (from:ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-74/fasta/gallus_gallus/cdna/) using Bowtie. A maximum of two mismatches per read were allowed. Only sequences that mapped to one location on the genome were retained. Read counts were identified for each mapped transcript.	The DEseq package from Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/) was then used to normalise read counts. Differential expression and associated statistical significance was computed using a negative binomial test from the DESeq package. Graphical representations and further analysis were performed using homemade R scripts. The mapping of dysregulated genes to the chicken karyotype was performed using Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html).
